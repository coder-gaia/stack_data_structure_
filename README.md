# 📝 Text Editor with Undo/Redo (Java)

In this project, I practiced using the *Stack* data structure (LIFO) in Java by implementing a basic text editor that supports *Undo* and *Redo* operations.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of stacks and how they can be applied to manage state in real-world scenarios, such as text editing and version control.

## 🚀 Features
- ➕ Insert new text (or tasks in the upgraded To-Do List mode).
- ↩ *Undo*: revert to a previous state.
- ↪ *Redo*: reapply the last undone state.
- 👀 Display the current text or task list.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- The fundamentals of the Stack class in Java: push, pop, isEmpty, and clear.
- How to implement an *Undo/Redo system* using stacks.
- How to handle *application state snapshots* with collections (List).
- Reinforced problem-solving skills by iteratively upgrading the project.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- *Java* (JDK 17+)
- *Stack* and *List* from Java Collections Framework

## 🎯 Next Steps
- Enhance the To-Do List with features like *task completion status* (e.g., mark as done).
- Add *persistent storage* (save and load tasks from a file).
- Create a more advanced editor with multi-level Undo/Redo history.
- Explore other data structures in new projects: *Queues, **Deques, and **HashMaps*.
