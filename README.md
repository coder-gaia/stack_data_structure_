# Text Editor with Undo/Redo (Java)

In this project, I'm practicing the **Stack** data structure (LIFO) in Java.  
This simple text editor allows inserting text and performing **Undo** and **Redo** operations.  

Through this project, I'm not only reinforcing my understanding of how a stack works, but also learning how to apply it in a practical context, simulating real-world features like text state management.

## Features
- Insert new text.
- Undo (revert to previous state).
- Redo (reapply the last undone state).
- Display current text.

## What I learned
- How the `Stack` class works in Java (`push`, `pop`, `isEmpty`, `clear`).
- How to implement an **Undo/Redo** mechanism.
- How to manage application state using data structures.
